# Project 1 : - Data Visiualization Website

<p>A web-based platform for data analysis is an online software application that allows users
to access , analyse and manipulate data from anywhere with an internet connection using a
web browser. This type of platform provides an alternative to traditional desktop - based
software for data analysis, such as Microsoft Excel or Tableau. Web based platforms for data
analysis typically include a range of features and tools users manage and analysed their data.
These may include data visualization tools. One of the key advantages of web based platforms
for data analysis is that it allows users to collaborate on the data project in real-time, regardless
of their physical location.As we know that we have two popular desktop applications for data
analysis i.e. Microsoft Excel and Tableau. To use these desktop applications, we need to
download these applications on our personal computer. In some cases we need pictorial
representation of data without downloading the desktop application. So, our goal is to design
websites which do online data analysis without storing that data on the server. In this system
we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. HTML and CSS is used for front end
development and JavaScript and python is used for backend development. In Python there are
some libraries which help us to analyze data for example pandas , flask ,plotly. With the help
of python libraries we can plot the charts. Nowadays python is the best and trending
programming language for data analysis.
